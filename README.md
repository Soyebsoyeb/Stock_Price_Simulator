# üìä Stock Price Simulator

The **Stock Price Simulator** is a C++ program designed to simulate future prices of a stock using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and **Monte Carlo Simulations**.

---

## üåü Nature of Stock Prices

Stock prices are random yet predictable to some extent. They are influenced by:

- Market news, earnings, and economic factors  
- Investor behavior  
- Random shocks  

**Statistical properties:**

1. **Non-negative:** Prices cannot go below zero  
2. **Log-normal returns:** Logarithm of returns roughly follows a normal distribution  
3. **Random walk:** Prices move up or down with some average drift and volatility

**OS Entropy Pool:** Modern operating systems maintain a pool of randomness (entropy pool) collected from unpredictable events.

- `rd()` ‚Üí generates a hardware/OS random integer  
- `mt19937 gen(rd())` ‚Üí initializes the fast PRNG  
- `dis(gen)` ‚Üí produces uniformly distributed floating-point numbers between 0 and 1  

**Box-Muller Function:** Converts uniform random values to standard normal values, which is crucial for GBM simulations.

**Other Important Terms:**

- **Volatility (\( \sigma \))**: How much a stock price fluctuates. High ‚Üí big swings, Low ‚Üí stable  
- **Risk**: Chance stock moves against expectations; partially captured by volatility  
- **Drift (\( \mu \))**: Expected upward/downward trend

## üìà Stock Price Simulation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

**Continuous-time SDE:**

\[
dS_t = \mu S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_t
\]

- \( S_t \) = stock price at time \( t \)  
- \( \mu \) = drift (expected return)  
- \( \sigma \) = volatility  
- \( W_t \) = standard Brownian motion  

**Discrete-time (Euler approximation):**

\[
S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \cdot \exp \Big[ (\mu - 0.5\sigma^2)\Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot Z \Big]
\]

where \( Z \sim N(0,1) \).  
GBM ensures **log-normal distribution**, aligning with real-world stock returns.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo is a **method** to generate many random paths of stock prices:

**Steps:**

1. Define parameters: \( S_0, \mu, \sigma, T \)  
2. Simulate a single path using GBM  
3. Repeat thousands of times  
4. Analyze the distribution of outcomes  

**Outputs:**

- Expected final price  
- Probability of loss/profit  
- Risk metrics (e.g., standard deviation, Value at Risk)  
- Option pricing (e.g., Black-Scholes estimation)  

---

### üîó GBM & Monte Carlo Relationship

- **GBM** = the model of price evolution  
- **Monte Carlo** = method to simulate & analyze many GBM paths  

**Analogy:**  
- GBM = the dice rule  
- Monte Carlo = rolling the dice 10,000 times and analyzing results  

---

## üìù Problem Summary

Stock prices are uncertain. Predicting future values is crucial for **risk management, investments, and options pricing**, but exact prediction is impossible.  

**Goal:** Simulate possible future prices of a stock over a time horizon considering **drift** and **volatility**.

---

## üîß Solution Approach

1. **GBM Model:**
   - Simulates stochastic price movement  
   - Incorporates drift (\( \mu \)) and volatility (\( \sigma \))  
   - Ensures positivity and log-normal distribution  

2. **Monte Carlo:**
   - Generates multiple independent GBM paths  
   - Computes mean, standard deviation, probability distribution of outcomes  

---

### ‚úÖ Implementation Overview

- Initialize parameters: \( S_0, \mu, \sigma, T \), steps, simulations  
- Run GBM simulation for each path  
- Collect final prices from all simulations  
- Save results for visualization (CSV/graphs)  
- Compute statistics: mean, standard deviation, etc.  

This approach provides a **probabilistic estimate of future stock prices**, widely used in **quantitative finance**.
