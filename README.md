# Stock_Price_Simulator

The Stock Price Simulator is a C++ program designed to simulate 
the future prices of a stock using geometric Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo Simulations.

(1) THE NATURE OF STOCK PRICES :->
  Stock prices are random and predictable influenced by:
  (a) Market news , earnings , economic factors.
  (b) Investor behaviour.
  (c) Random shocks.


Yet, they exhibit some statistical properties:->
(1) Non-negative -> A stock price can't go below zero
(2) Returns are approximately log - normal -> the logarithm of stock returns roughly follows a normal distribution
(3) Random Walk -> prices move up or down with some average drift and volatility
